Microsoft unveiled Windows Azure in early October 2008 but it went to live after February 2010. Later in 2014, Microsoft changed its name from Windows Azure to Microsoft Azure. Azure provided a service platform for .NET services, SQL Services, and many Live Services. Many people were still very skeptical about “the cloud”. As an industry, we were entering a brave new world with many possibilities. Microsoft Azure is getting bigger and better in coming days. More tools and more functionalities are getting added. It has two releases as of now. It’s famous version Micorosft Azure v1 and later Microsoft Azure v2. Microsoft Azure v1 was more like JSON script driven then the new version v2, which has interactive UI for simplification and easy learning. Microsoft Azure v2 is still in the preview version.

-Data and Analytics: Azure provides a suite of data and analytics services, such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Data Lake, allowing users to store, analyze, and gain insights from their data.

-AI and Machine Learning: Azure offers a set of tools and services for artificial intelligence and machine learning, including Azure Machine Learning and Azure Cognitive Services, to build intelligent applications and models.

-IoT (Internet of Things): Azure IoT Suite helps connect, monitor, and manage IoT devices and collect and analyze data from them.

-Security and Compliance: Azure places a strong emphasis on security and compliance, offering features like Azure Security Center and Azure Policy to help organizations protect their data and meet regulatory requirements.

-Global Reach: Azure has data centers in multiple regions worldwide, allowing users to deploy applications and services close to their target audience, improving performance and reducing latency.

-Hybrid Cloud: Azure supports hybrid cloud scenarios, allowing organizations to seamlessly integrate their on-premises infrastructure with Azure resources, creating a more flexible and scalable environment.

-Ecosystem and Integration: Azure integrates with a wide variety of development tools and technologies, making it easy for developers to work with familiar tools and frameworks.
