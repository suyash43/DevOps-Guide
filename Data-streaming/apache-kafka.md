## Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.

Core Capabilities:
- Deliver messages at network limited throughput using a cluster of machines with latencies as low as 2ms.
- Scale production clusters up to a thousand brokers, trillions of messages per day, petabytes of data, hundreds of thousands of partitions. Elastically expand and contract storage and processing.
- Store streams of data safely in a distributed, durable, fault-tolerant cluster.
- Stretch clusters efficiently over availability zones or connect separate clusters across geographic regions.


Ecosystem: 
- Process streams of events with joins, aggregations, filters, transformations, and more, using event-time and exactly-once processing.
- Kafkaâ€™s out-of-the-box Connect interface integrates with hundreds of event sources and event sinks including Postgres, JMS, Elasticsearch, AWS S3, and more.
- Read, write, and process streams of events in a vast array of programming languages.
- Large ecosystem of open source tools: Leverage a vast array of community-driven tooling.
