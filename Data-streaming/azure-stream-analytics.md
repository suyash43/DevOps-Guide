## Azure Stream Analytics

Azure Stream Analytics is a fully managed stream processing engine that is designed to analyze and process large volumes of streaming data with sub-millisecond latencies. Patterns and relationships can be identified in data that originates from a variety of input sources including applications, devices, sensors, clickstreams, and social media feeds. These patterns can be used to trigger actions and initiate workflows such as creating alerts, feeding information to a reporting tool, or storing transformed data for later use. Stream Analytics is also available on the Azure IoT Edge runtime, enabling to process data directly on IoT devices.

Features:
- End-to-end analytics pipeline that is production-ready in minutes with familiar SQL syntax and extensible with JavaScript and C# custom code
- Rapid scalability with elastic capacity to build robust streaming data pipelines and analyze millions of events at subsecond latencies
- Hybrid architectures for stream processing with the ability to run the same queries in the cloud and on the edge
- Enterprise-grade reliability with built-in recovery and built-in machine learning capabilities for advanced scenarios
