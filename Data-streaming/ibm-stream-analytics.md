## IBM Stream Analytics

IBM Streaming Analytics for IBM Cloud evaluates a broad range of streaming data — unstructured text, video, audio, geospatial and sensor — helping organizations spot opportunities and risks and make decisions in real time.

Features:
- Development support: Rich Eclipse-based, visual IDE lets solution architects visually build applications or use familiar programming languages like Java™, Scala or Python.
- Rich data connections: Data engineers can connect with virtually any data source — whether structured, unstructured or streaming — and integrate with Hadoop, Spark and other data infrastructures.
- Analysis and visualization: Built-in domain analytics — like machine learning, natural language, spatial-temporal, text, acoustics and more — to create adaptive streams applications.
